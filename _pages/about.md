I'm a physics Ph.D. Student at [Columbia University](https://physics.columbia.edu/content/jiawei-zang){:target="\_blank"} in the field of computational and theoretical condensed matter physics. My current research focuses on modelling the physics of the twisted 2D materials. I'm now using the dynamical mean field method to gain insight into this problem.
