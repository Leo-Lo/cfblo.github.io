I'm a physics PhD Student at [Columbia University](https://physics.columbia.edu/content/jiawei-zang){:target="\_blank"} in the field of computational and theoretical condensed matter physics. My current research focuses on modelling the physics of the twisted 2D materials. I’m amazed by the magic of the scale. When a supercell is formed, everything is different. The bandwidth becomes extremely small, the electron-electron interaction becomes dominant, and people could reach a high-temperature range compared to the bandwidth. I’m now using the dynamical mean-field method to gain insight into this problem. 

Before I was fully attracted by theoretical many-body physics, I studied experimental physics in my first year of graduate school and in my undergraduate years. I used Muon spin relaxation (muSR) techniques to examine structural and dynamical processes in materials on an atomic scale.
