# Intro

There are a few interesting tranformation that appears in quantum theories.


# The list


[**Holstein–Primakoff transformation**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein%E2%80%93Primakoff_transformation): maps from bosonic ladder operators to spin operators

[**Jordon-Wigner transformation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation): maps from spin operators to fermionic ladder operators

I purposely put the above two transformations together, as it begs the naive question: if we compose the two maps one after the other, does that mean there is a map from bosonic ladder operators to fermionic ladder operators? This smells like some supersymmetry.

[**Klein transformation**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_transformation): used to fix the (anti-)commutation relation between field operators such that the canonical (anti-)commutation relation is satisfied in accordance with the spin-statistics theorem.

[**Bogoliubov–Valatin transformation**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoliubov_transformation): maps from bosonic to bosonic or from fermionic to fermionic; it is used to diagonalize the BCS Hamiltonian.

[**Jordan-Schwinger map**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_map): according to Wikipedia, it is "a map from matrices Mij to bilinear expressions of quantum oscillators which expedites computation of representations of Lie algebras occurring in physics".

[**Schrieffer-Wolff transformation**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrieffer%E2%80%93Wolff_transformation): This transformation is quite different from the previous ones. It is used to obtain the effective low-energy effective Hamiltonian, by diagonalize a Hamiltonian to 1st order in interaction. This is the operator version of the 2nd-order perturbation theory, where virtual-state is used to connect two low-energy states.
