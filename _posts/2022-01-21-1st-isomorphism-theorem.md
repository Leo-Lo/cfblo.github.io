# Motivation

As I often forget how to prove the isomorphism theorems in group theory, here is one (in all painstaking details) for the record. 

# Theorem statement

Given a homomorphism $$\Phi: G \rightarrow H$$, then 
- (1) $$\text{ker}(\Phi)\trianglelefteq G$$
- (2) $$G/\text{ker}(\Phi) \equiv \text{im}(\Phi)$$

## Proof of (1)

We will follow a 3-step process: 
- 1) Determine what is $$\text{ker}(\Phi)$$ as a set.
- 2) Show $$\text{ker}(\Phi)$$ is a group.
- 3) Show $$\text{ker}(\Phi)$$ is a normal subgroup.

### For 1)

$$\text{ker}(\Phi)=\\\{g\in G | \Phi(g) = e_H\\\}$$, where $$e_H$$ is an identity element in $$H$$. 


### For 2)

Check the group axioms:
- Identity: 
- Inverse: 
- Associativity: 
- Closure:
