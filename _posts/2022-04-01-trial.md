I want to prove the following resolution to the identity: 

$$
\mathbb 1 = \frac{1}{\pi} \int d^2\alpha\space \ket{\alpha} \bra{\alpha} 
$$

where $$d^2\alpha = d\mathbb{Re}(\alpha) d\mathbb{Im}(\alpha)= \frac{1}{2}d\alpha d\bar\alpha$$, and the state $$\ket{\alpha} = e^{-|\alpha|^2/2}e^{\alpha a^\dagger} \ket{0}$$ denotes a coherent state.


## Reflection

When I first work it out it is just to see where things go without worrying too much about correctness (since I was pretty clueless lol). But in retrospect, the validity of this method lies in the normal-ordering of the operators in the RHS of the identity. Even though completing the square seems to scramble the ordering of the ladder operators, as long as we assert that at the end we have to recover the normal-ordered operators again, then we are safe. 

It is important to note that I am not applying the normal ordering as an operation. If one tries to normal order an equation that wasn't originally in normal order, we can get non-sensical results such as the following (due to S. Coleman):
$$
a^\dagger a = a a^\dagger -1  \xrightarrow{?} :a^\dagger a:\space =\space : a a^\dagger : -1 \implies a^\dagger a = a^\dagger a -1 \implies 0 = -1
$$
Instead, I start with an expression that is already in normal order, do the Gaussian integrals that apparently scramble the normal order, but insist in the end that it is still in normal order.
