%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Inherited topological superconductivity in two-dimensional Dirac semimetals},
  author={Chiu Fan Bowen Lo and Hoi Chun Po and Andriy H Nevidomskyy},
  abstract={Under what conditions does a superconductor inherit topologically protected nodes from its parent normal state? In the context of Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry, the pairing order parameter is classified by monopole harmonics and necessarily nodal [Li and Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett., 120, 067003 (2018)]. Here, we show that a similar conclusion could also apply to 2D Dirac semimetals, although the conditions for the existence of nodes are more complex, depending on the pairing matrix structure in the valley and sublattice space. We analytically and numerically analyze the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes quasi-particle spectra for Dirac systems based on the monolayer as well as twisted bilayer graphene. We find that in the cases of intra-valley intra-sublattice pairing, and inter-valley inter-sublattice pairing, the point nodes in the BdG spectrum (which are inherited from the Dirac cone in the normal state) are protected by a 1D winding number. The nodal structure of the superconductivity is confirmed using tight-binding models of monolayer and twisted bilayer graphene. Notably, the BdG spectrum is nodal even with a momentum-independent "bare" pairing, which, however, acquires momentum-dependence and point nodes upon projection to the Bloch states on the topologically nontrivial Fermi surface, similar in spirit to the Li--Haldane monopole superconductor and the Fu--Kane proximity-induced superconductor on the surface of a topological insulator.},

  abstract={Tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) is an atomically layered transition metal dichalcogenide whose physical properties change systematically from monolayer to bilayer and few-layer versions. In this report, we use apertureless scattering-type near-field optical microscopy operating at Terahertz (THz) frequencies and cryogenic temperatures to study the distinct THz range electromagnetic responses of mono-, bi- and trilayer WTe2 in the same multi-terraced micro-crystal. THz nano-images of monolayer terraces uncovered weakly insulating behavior that is consistent with transport measurements. The near-field signal on bilayer regions shows moderate metallicity with negligible temperature dependence. Subdiffractional THz imaging data together with theoretical calculations involving thermally activated carriers favor the semimetal scenario with Δ≈−10meV over the semiconductor scenario for bilayer WTe2. Also, we observed clear metallic behavior of the near-field signal on trilayer regions. Our data are consistent with the existence of surface plasmon polaritons in the THz range confined to trilayer terraces in our specimens. Finally, data for microcrystals up to 12 layers thick reveal how the response of a few-layer WTe2 asymptotically approaches the bulk limit.},

  abstract={Natural hyperbolic materials with dielectric permittivities of opposite signs along different principal axes can confine long-wavelength electromagnetic waves down to the nanoscale, well below the diffraction limit. Confined electromagnetic waves coupled to phonons in hyperbolic dielectrics including hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and α-$MoO_3$ are referred to as hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs). HPP dissipation at ambient conditions is substantial, and its fundamental limits remain unexplored. Here, we exploit cryogenic nanoinfrared imaging to investigate propagating HPPs in isotopically pure hBN and naturally abundant α-MoO3 crystals. Close to liquid-nitrogen temperatures, losses for HPPs in isotopic hBN drop significantly, resulting in propagation lengths in excess of 8 μm, with lifetimes exceeding 5 ps, thereby surpassing prior reports on such highly confined polaritonic modes. Our nanoscale, temperature-dependent imaging reveals the relevance of acoustic phonons in HPP damping and will be instrumental in mitigating such losses for miniaturized mid-infrared technologies operating at liquid-nitrogen temperatures.},
